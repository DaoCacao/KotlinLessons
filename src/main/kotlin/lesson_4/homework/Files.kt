/**
 * So if you successfully implemented your own collections, you can read about file system in Kotlin.
 * https://www.studytonight.com/kotlin/kotlin-file-handling
 *
 * To do:
 * - Read about work with files in Kotlin.
 * - Create a file with the name "file.txt" in the root of the project.
 * - Write the following text to the file: "Hello, world!"
 * - Read the text from the file and print it to the console (file should be closed after using, use close() method or use() function, read about both).
 *
 * Feel free to implement your collections using the file system (make separate implementation for each collection).
 *
 * Good luck!
